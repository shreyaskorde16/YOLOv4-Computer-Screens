We used the __[labelimg tool](https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg)__ to annotate the images and provide labels to the bounding boxes when creating the dataset. For the creation of an excellent dataset that can effectively train the model, it is essential to select high-quality, well-balanced images.
